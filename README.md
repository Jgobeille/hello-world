# hello-world

My name is Jamie Gobeille.I am from Cincinnati, Ohio and I am brand new to the world of programming and web development.
I consider myself a life learner with a passion and dedication to reaching my full potential. 
I think that learning to program will get me to where I want to be in life.

I hope to be able to contribute to many new projects and be an active member of Github!

Thank you!
